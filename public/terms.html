        <h2>1. Purpose of the Platform</h2>
        <p>
            This system is designed to securely manage, store, and verify digital evidence using

        <h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and credentials.</li>

        <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            The platform is provided on an "as-is" basis. The developers are not liable for
            misuse, data loss caused by user error, or external security breaches beyond reasonable control.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
            These terms may be updated periodically. Continued use of the platform implies
            acceptance of the revised terms.
