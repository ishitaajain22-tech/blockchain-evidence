### Expert Witness Guidelines
**Sample Expert Testimony:**
```
Q: Can you explain blockchain technology in simple terms?
A: Imagine a notebook that's copied to thousands of computers around the world. Every time someone writes in the notebook, all the copies are updated. If someone tries to change an old entry, the other copies would show the change is fake.
```
